                        LGBTQ+ night showing 'The imitation game' and many more. In additon, whilst at Expedia I organised and hosted a Women in Tech event at our office for graduates around the UK to attend.

                <h4> A Computer Vision-Based Fall Detection System for the Elderly</h4>
                <p>
                    The project tackled the issue of elderly people experiencing a high number of falls in the home and the time taken to provide assistance as a result of the fall,
                     by investigating the potential of vision-based fall detection systems and as a result of this,
                     creates an end-to-end proof of concept system, capable of detecting falls with an accuracy of 92% in controlled environments.
                     The project explores and makes use of Convolutional Neural Networks in order to perform the classification of fall events and
                      then leverages this as part of the overall functionality. Lastly, this project creates a progressive web application which
                      allows a user to monitor and track the person at risk.
